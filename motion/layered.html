        <h1>Layered animation</h1>
        <p>Layers in this context are not related to visual stacks of elements. Layered animation refers to the
            animating of various different properties across multiple objects within a shared hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Layers are what give an animation depth. This is one of the key things which make an animation nice to look
            at.</p>

        <h1>Demo</h1>

        <div class="demo">
            <button>Animate</button>
            <div class="block layeredcontainer">
                <div class="layeredchild">
                    <div class="knorrig"></div>
                    <h2>KNORRIG</h2>
                    <p>Een spannende film voor jong en oud.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>This animated thumbnail looks pretty nice! To the user it reads as 1 animation: the thumbnail appears and
            voila. However, this animation consists of several individual animating elements. Each animated with their
            own speeds and animation curves.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> even though the 'tail' of the animation is quite long, the element can be considered
            ready for interaction quite quickly. You can almost say that in cases like this you can divide the animation
            into a <strong>primary</strong> and <strong>secondary</strong> category. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary being the scaling animation with which the frame appears.</li>
            <li>Secondary being the long tail animations which subtly ease out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When working with UI, you'll most likely be dealing with object hierarchies. These hierarchies are ideal for
            animations such as this one. Parent transformations directly translate to the child objects as well. Working
            your way from top (parent) to bottom (children) is a great way to iterate through animation designs.</p>

        <p>tl;dr animate all the things. Take into consideration primary and secondary layers of animation.</p>

        <h1>Advanced uses</h1>
        <p>The previous example is a pretty straightforward state toggle that controls all of the parameters.</p>
        <p>Taking a look at some of the animations Apple is implementing on their iPhones and iPads for example, it becomes a whole other story.</p>

        // Loop through each 'demo' element

            // Find the button and block elements within each 'demo' element
            const button = demoElement.querySelector('button');
